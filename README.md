# ATtiny-device-examples
Example code for using the ATtiny Device PCB to make I2C devices with Attiny85

## What is ATtiny Device?
The ATtiny Device PCB is a custom breakout board that I've designed for the Attiny85 chip that exposes the power pins and the I2C pins on a breakout header. With it you can build custom I2C devices and connect them with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and other microcontrollers. 

You can get the board from my Tindie shop on the link [here](https://www.tindie.com/products/taste_the_code/attiny-device-pcb/)
